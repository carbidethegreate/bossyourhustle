# BossMyHustle Repository Guidelines

This file applies to the entire repository.

## Development
- Keep the feature list in `README.md` up to date for every module.
- Document new modules and significant changes.
- Avoid committing secrets such as API keys or passwords.
- Use black, white, and gray with rose highlights for any front-end styling.
- Ensure the front end reflects background activity (API calls, errors, etc.).

## Testing
- Run `npm test` and `npm run lint` if available.
- Run any PHP test suites (e.g., `composer test`) when present.
- If a script is missing, still run the command and record the output.

## Commit Messages
- Use imperative mood and limit the subject line to 50 characters.
